The purpose of these programs were to test for the best dimensions for selective deforestation in a grid pattern.
The ideal pattern would minimise damage from forest fires and minimise trees required to be deforested.

forestfunctions.py contains functions that will:
  1. Simulate a forest fire on a grid
  2. Show how many trees are deforested (empty), healthy (tree), on fire (fire), burnt (charred)
  3. Selectivelty and evenly deforest i rows and j columns of trees to form a grid pattern

forestfunctions.py contains all the functions required for the simulation. Whereas forest.py is where the user can play around with parameters and change the way the simulation is executed.

Parameters that can be changed in forest.py include:
  1. Total time of simulation
  2. Size of region
  3. Probability of density of forest
  4. Speed of simulation
  5. Iterate over i and j to change the length and width of the grid pattern
